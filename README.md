# Ship Escape

## Game Theme
You are an explorer who sailed in-hope for discovering a new piece of land. Unfortunately, a big storm hit your ship. Having lost all hope, you just wait for your death. Just wishing that it's painless. By some miracle, you somehow survive but find yourself here in an unknown area. You now have to find your ship and get a map to return back home.

## Walkthrough

a cave who asks you to bring him a torch, and he would give you the map in-return.

Now make a wall to repair the ship.<br>

A small note: Some commands like rest, drop etc. are not used here (since the game can be won without using them if the player plays perfectly.)
Rest makes you fall asleep and causes the time to change.
Older commands - drop, examine, and inventory from the orignal implementation still work as expected.

## NOTE
When using the GUI version of the game, please maximize the window so that no text is left out of the screen. In the GUI version,
the player status and the time are in the bottom left corner of the screen
